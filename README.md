`===============================
 ===== Personal Links page =====
 ===============================`

Thank you for your purchase! We hope our product can help you share your social links with others.

The page is written in Next.js + React. If you want to continue development on it, edit app/page.tsx.


===== Configuration =====

To configure the page, open the CONFIG.ts file in the same directory as this README.md file.
Comments are included to guide you through configuration, however the settings are mostly self-explanatory.

===== Deployment =====

Once you have configured the page, you can deploy it to a server.
We recommend using Vercel (https://vercel.com) for this, which will make this process very easy.
Vercel also has a very generous free plan, so no payment will be needed.

To deploy run:
```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Log in to your vercel account, accept all the default options, and the page will be deployed to Vercel.

==== Running locally =====
If you wish to try out your page before deploying, run
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
